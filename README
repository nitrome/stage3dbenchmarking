This repo is a series of benchmarking tests for different rendering methods in Flash on a desktop PC and on iOS.

The purpose was to build worst-case-scenarios for each of the different rendering techniques as well as test claims of the speed of Stage3D.

Blitting (BitmapData.copyPixels), MovieClips, Starling and ND2D were tested on the following machines:

Dell Precision T3400
Intel(R) Core(TM)2 Duo CPU
E8400 @3.00GHz
2.99GHz, 2.00GB of RAM
NVIDIA Quadro NVS 290

And on an iPod 3G

The Flash files are all CS5.5

Flash Player 11.2 support was added to Flash CS5.5 using the tutorial here:

Air3.2 was overlaid on to Flash CS5.5 using the tutorial here:

There still remains testing to be done on other devices as well as testing Stage3D without the use of a framework designed to generalise the task for those new to Stage3D.

Please test the code for yourself and do not settle upon my own results as verbatim, they may after scrutiny be as valid as faster-than-light-neutrinos.
